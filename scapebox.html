        <div>
            <p style=" background-color:#272121; width: 800px; font: size 15px; color: white;">We’ve all been there:
                trapped
                in
                a small,
                slightly dingy room, systemically lifting any item that’s not nailed
                down
                and peering underneath in hopes of discovering a code. Tugging strings to try and unhook an out-of-reach
                key.
                Frantically jiggling the dials of a padlock looking for that one magic combination.

                There’s a unique pleasure to escape rooms - and it’s one that, by this point, pretty much everyone is
                familiar
                with.
                After first emerging from the darkness sometime in the early 2000s, escape rooms have spent the past
                decade
                pushing
                through cracks in high streets the world over and blossoming – at last count, there were over 1,500
                escape
                rooms
                in
                the UK alone according to Exit Games.

                Actually visiting an escape room in person isn’t always an option, though, whether because of a lack of
                local
                escape
                rooms, because everyone is too busy "working", or because they’re fully booked. If any of that sounds
                familiar,
                well, you’re in luck. There are plenty of escape room games out there that’ll let you escape a room
                inside
                your
                own
                home, without having to ask someone to lock the door from outside and wedge a chair under the handle.

                <span style="color:brown; font-size: 30px;">The Unlock! series of escape room games sees players use a
                    combination of cards and a free companion app to
                    solve puzzles.</span>
                <br>
                The magic of Unlock! is the way it manages to conjure an escape room right there on your dining table,
                with
                nothing but rectangles of card and the occasional input on your phone or tablet using its companion app.
                Each
                set consists of a single deck, with numbers on the back and bright illustrations on the front.

                You start with a room card that establishes the theme (there’s everything from dusty temples to cartoon
                circuses
                on offer) but, more importantly, is littered with numbers and letters. You find the corresponding
                numbered
                cards
                in the deck and lay them out, building the space up as you explore it. Cards might represent a locked
                door,
                a
                mechanism solved with a digital puzzle on the app or an item you’ll need to escape. These items are the
                heart of
                the game. To combine them - shoving a videotape in an old VHS machine, for example - you simply add
                together
                their numbers and check if there’s a card that matches the sum.

                Between shuffling desperately through the deck and peering closely at cards looking for hidden numbers,
                it’s
                easy to imagine you’re searching a physical space for clues. When the door does finally swing open to
                reveal
                a
                whole new room, it’s just as thrilling as the real thing.

                Unlock! makes a good starting point for escape room games, because publisher Space Cowboy offers
                print-and-play
                demo rooms you can sample for the cost of a few sheets of A4 and a splash of printer ink. These are
                generally
                shorter adventures and you’ll need to make sure you print them in colour at a high resolution so you
                don’t
                end
                up squinting at an indecipherable visual puzzle, but it’s a great way of trying the game before you buy.

                <span style="color:brown; font-size: 30px;">Escape Room in a Box lives up to its name with a series of
                    padlocks
                    to crack open with clues.</span>
                <br>
                At the other end of the spectrum is Escape Room in a Box, which brings an escape room to your table by
                piling it
                high with chunky components: heavy envelopes, building blocks and miniature cases held shut with actual
                padlocks. As fun as it is to fiddle with the assorted bits, it wouldn’t mean a thing without equally
                chunky
                puzzles to go along with them.

                Escape Room in a Box’s components allow the designers to think a little more, ahem, outside of the box.
                There’s
                one that involves… well, we won’t spoil it, but it requires you to use a household item you’re unlikely
                to
                have
                ever used for any other board game. Plus, because everything’s right there on the table, there aren’t
                many
                external rules to learn - meaning you can drop this in front of pretty much any escape room fan without
                explanation and they’ll be able to get stuck right in.

                It’s a big (and pricey) box for a single hour-and-a-half experience, but - like most of the escape room
                games on
                this list - Escape Room in a Box can be packaged back up with the help of an eraser, some careful
                folding
                and an
                online guide, then passed along to a friend. Yes, it’s technically secondhand, but a box of plastic will
                always
                feel like a gift to us.

                <span style="color:brown; font-size: 30px;">Escape Room: The Game's puzzles centre around inputting
                    codes
                    into
                    the impressive electronic Chrono Decoder.</span>
                <br>
                If having something you can actually touch is an important part of the escape room experience for you,
                try
                Escape Room: The Game, which comes with possibly the best toy in all of board gaming: a proper chunky
                ‘batteries
                not included’ Christmas-morning hunk of plastic known as ‘The Chrono Decoder’. There are decoder guides
                engraved
                on either side and an LCD countdown timer that helps give things a tense bomb-defusal vibe, but most
                important
                are the four slots on top.

                Each room - there’s three included in the box - requires you to crack three codes in an hour, which you
                do
                by
                slotting plastic keys into the decoder. Each key is marked with a mixture of numbers, shapes, letters
                and
                directions, so it’s more than just a novel way of inputting a four-digit code (though it’s definitely
                also
                that)
                and the process of getting to those codes involves hefty multi-part puzzles where you’ll have to combine
                logic,
                deciphering skills and a dash of lateral thinking.

                This structure makes Escape Room: The Game perfect for larger groups, because every player can be
                working on
                a
                different aspect at once, without treading on each other’s toes or hitting a progress-gated dead end.
                The
                only
                problem is fighting over who gets to put the keys in.

                <span style="color:brown; font-size: 30px;">Deckscape conjures an escape room game from little more than
                    a deck of cards.</span>
                <br>
                Keys or padlocks or no, a lot of escape room game solutions - both out in the world and in their
                cardboard equivalents - ultimately boil down to short sequences of numbers or, if you’re feeling spicy,
                letters. Deckscape sidesteps that in the simplest possible way: each puzzle card presents all the
                necessary info and a question. Once you think you’ve got the answer, you just flip the card over to see
                if you were right. Any incorrect answer gets marked down as you go, then adds a two-minute penalty onto
                your score at the end.This avoids the frustration of getting snagged on a single puzzle, resulting in a
                smooth escape room experience that’s a little more linear and story-led, with twists and branching story
                decisions and even multiple endings. Deckscape is halfway between an escape room game and Usborne Puzzle
                Adventure book - if you remember those from childhood library trips - but the puzzles are still more
                than fiendish enough to trip up a tableful of grown-ups.

                    room game in London.</span>
                <br>
                Our next escape room game is a slightly different proposition to the others on this list, but just as
                fun. ClueQuest is an actual escape room, based in London’s King’s Cross. Faced with lockdown, the team
                leapt into action and started working on a crowdfunded escape room game people could play at home.

                The first episode is out now, with two more due to follow soon. You can buy the print-and-play game
                version, or if that’s not an option (fair warning, it does involve a lot of cutting out - after half an
                hour of prep, our table looked like the site of a paper doll massacre) you can pay a little extra to
                have it posted out to you.
                Either way, you’ll end up with a pile of paper-based puzzles, plus access to a companion website where
                you enter your answers and watch videos to introduce and advance the story. It’s got a neat
                found-footage aesthetic - grainy CCTV videos, newspaper cuttings and photocopied satellite photos - that
                suits the sci-fi spy story beautifully.

                Plus, because it’s ultimately a load of A4 sheets, it’s easy to pass on or post to a friend once you’re
                done. Recycling is important!

                <br>
                We come to the escape room game generally considered the gold standard of play-at-home escape rooms -
                and
                for
                good reason.

                Each Exit: The Game set - there are now well over a dozen out there - contains a single ‘room’, with a
                variety
                of difficulty levels and themes across the series. Whether you’re exploring a creepy cabin or solving a
                murder
                aboard the Orient Express, the real star of every Exit game is the puzzles. Or, as the game insists on
                calling
                them, ‘riddles’. Fair enough - there are some real brandy swishers here, problems that’ll have you
                cursing
                the
                designers one minute and applauding their genius the next. Expect optical illusions and building
                puzzles, as
                well as solutions that use your entire body and test those scissor skills you honed preparing ClueQuest.
                Exit: The Game is the only non-reusable escape room game on this list - every set has you cutting up
                cards
                and
                ripping out pages - but, as with a legacy board game, it’s totally worth it. Its puzzles use every part
                of
                the
                buffalo, pushing at the limits of what you can do with a box full of cards and paper and the occasional
                extra
                component.

                You know that feeling after an escape room, where you’re walking down the street and everyone’s
                excitedly
                comparing notes on what they did and enthusing about kinds of puzzles they’ve never seen before? Exit is
                the
                escape room game most likely to give you that feeling.
